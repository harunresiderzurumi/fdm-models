This repository contains FeynRules implementations of the flavoured dark matter models studied in the following references:
  
1405.6709  
1702.08457  
2109.10357  
2309.10700 (also studied in 2211.03809) 

All models are implemented according to the convention that the first generation of dark matter is the heaviest and the third generation the lightest. Each implementation contains a UFO folder, a mathematica notebook "DMFV_XY_Z.nb" that generates the UFO folder and all necessary FeynRules files. Also, for each model we have included a mathematica function "ccop_XY_Z.m", which is generated by the notebook "ccop_XY_Z.nb". This file has to be used in order to correctly calculate the respective coupling matrix based on the fundamental model parameters, such that the mass hierarchy explained above is satisfied. The output generated by "ccop_XY_Z.nb" then contains all model parameters in the right format such that they can be fed into MC generators like MadGraph. Each "ccop_XY_Z.nb" notebook contains a minimal example of how to use "ccop_XY_Z.m".
