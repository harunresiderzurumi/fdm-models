This repository contains FeynRules implementations of the flavoured dark matter models studied in the following references:
  
1405.6709  
1702.08457  
1711.10493
2109.10357  
2309.10700 (also studied in 2211.03809) 

All models are implemented according to the convention that the first generation of dark matter is the heaviest and the third generation the lightest. Each implementation contains a UFO folder, a mathematica notebook "DMFV_XY_Z.nb" that generates the UFO folder and all necessary FeynRules files. Also, for each model we have included a mathematica notebook "example_XY_Z.nb". This file defines mathematica functions which are subsequently used to correctly calculate the respective coupling matrix based on the fundamental model parameters, such that the mass hierarchy explained above is satisfied. The output generated by "example_XY_Z.nb" can then be fed into MC generators like MadGraph.
